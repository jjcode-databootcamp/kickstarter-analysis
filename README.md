# kickstarter Challenge Analysis 

## Overview 
Cleaned up, orgainized and filted Kickstarter data in order to uncover trends  based on the following data set using excel:
 - Project Title
 - Project Description
 - Goal Amount
 - Pledged Amount (raised amount)
 - County 
 - Currency 
 - Funding Date Range (Start and End)
 - Project Launch Date
 - Number of Backers
 - Staff Picks
 - Spotlight
 - Category 
 - Subcategory 


## Analysis and Challenges
**Overview:** The goal is to uncovered any trends that will lead to best practices that will be useful for fund raising purposes. Like, which month to start a kickstarter? How much money to set the goal to in order to be successful? Here is a few of those questions answered below: 

- It was discovered that Kickstarter who start there fund raising campaigns in May have a higher percentage of success in meeting their fund raising goal.

- It was also disovered that Kickstarters in the theater category have a higer number of kickstarters count overall then any other category

**Challenges:** I find it to be difficult to enter the arguments for the excel functions correctly. It was really hard to see which variations and the sequence of the variations that I have to input it in. It is very difficult to apply more paramters to functions and everything is very manaual and the functions within excel are repetitively apply and can't be mass apply easily for a specify data set.  I find locking the columns with "$" was overall generally having my dataset stay with the correct ranage when dragging formula to other columns. 

## Results 
1. Theater Outcomes by Launch Date:
- There are very few theater kickstarters that are canceled completely. Most of the kickstarters are either "successful" or "failed"
- Based on the chart it appears that successfully meeting the fund rasing goal is higher the failure.

2. Outcomes based on Goals
- Ther are 0 canceled Kickstarters for teh category of "plays". Majority of the Kickstarters for "plays" have a goal amount of less then $10k

3. Limitations and Recommendations
- One of the analysis that we can do is to look at how many backers took to successfully meet a kickstarter goal 
- This analysis didn't specify which method the kickstarter used to fund raise. This information would be helpful to see which method is most effective (email, telephone, digital ads, word of mouth, social post, events and etc...)
